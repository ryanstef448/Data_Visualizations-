# Data_Visualizations
Projects to demonstrate various data visualization tools and techniques including Excel, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.

The ability to transform large and complex datasets into visualizations makes it easy to comprehend patterns and trends from data.  This allows stakeholders to make informed decisions quickly and confidently.  Using bar charts, line graphs, heat maps, and scatter plots can help bridge the gap between the raw data and meaningful insights.  

# Project 1 - Visualize NCAA D1 Mens Basketball Championships (1980-2024).  
## Steps Followed in this project

- Download the data from https://www.ncaa.com/history/basketball-men/d1 and create CSV file.  
- Imported the CSV files into a Pandas Dataframe.
- Performed the Exploratory Data Analysis and data cleansing of the imported data.
- Feature engineering: Split the Score data (ex. 75-60) into 2 columns to display as Winning and Losing Scores.
- Used Matplotlib.pyplot to generate visualization.
- Plotted the data using a bar graph.
